This is suggestion for using the Paderborn University corperate design in LaTeX-Beamer. Feel free to optimize this implementation.

Important information:
Due to the font specification of the CD (Segoe UI), it is necessary to have this font installed and to use XeLaTeX for compiling.

Install Segoe UI
